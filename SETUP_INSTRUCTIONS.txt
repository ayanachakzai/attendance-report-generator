├── Students_Attendance_list_Oct-25_intake_updated_till_25_Jan_26.xlsx  (attendance data)
└── ATTENDANCE_REPORT-SST.docx  (template)
```

2. Open `attendance_report_generator.py`
3. Click the "Run" button (▶️) in the top right
   OR press F5
   OR open Terminal and type: `python attendance_report_generator.py`

## STEP 5: Check Results

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Error: "No module named pandas"
- Solution: Run `pip install pandas` in terminal

### Error: "No such file or directory"
- Solution: Make sure all 3 files are in the same folder
- Solution: Check file names match exactly (including spaces)

### Error: "Permission denied"
- Solution: Close any open Word documents

## CUSTOMIZING THE SCRIPT

### Change attendance ranges:
Find this section in the code (around line 130):
```python
if attendance_percent >= 80:
    attendance_category = "Excellent attendance"
```
Change the numbers (80, 70, 60) to your preferred ranges.

### Change output folder name:
Find this line (around line 55):
```python
OUTPUT_DIR = 'attendance_reports'
```
Change 'attendance_reports' to whatever you want.
